/*CR needs to make a rectangular box for his physics class project. He has bought P cm of wire and S cm2 of special paper. He would like to use all the wire (for the 12 edges) and paper (for the 6 sides) to make the box.

What is the largest volume of the box that CR can make?

Input Format

The first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 10).

Constraints

Each test case contains two integers P and S in a line (1 ≤ P ≤ 40000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 20000). You may assume that there always exists an optimal solution for the given input cases.

Output Format

For each test case, print a real number that is the largest volume of the box that Johnny can make, rounded to two decimal places

First case: the dimensions of the largest box may be 3, 1 and 1.
Second case: the dimensions of the largest box may be 7/3, 4/3 and 4/3.*/
