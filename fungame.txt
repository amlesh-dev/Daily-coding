Mrinal is a coder from BVCOE. He always takes his laptop with him wherever he goes. One day (while on a trek trip ) a monster challenged him to solve one easy task else he was going to kill him.the task is as follows- Given a series of n numbers a1, a2, ..., an and a number of magic-queries. A magic-query is a pair (i, j) (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n). For each magic-query (i, j), you have to return the number of distinct elements in the subsequence ai, ai+1, ..., aj.

Input Format

Line 1: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 30000). Line 2: n numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^6). Line 3: q (1 ≤ q ≤ 200000), the number of magic-queries. In the next q lines, each line contains 2 numbers i, j representing a magic-query (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n).

Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 30000 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^6 1 ≤ q ≤ 200000 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n

Output Format

For each magic-query (i, j), print the number of distinct elements in the subsequence ai, ai+1, ..., aj in a single line.
